# ParallelDistributedProcessingProjects
These are the assignments I have done as part of my "Introduction to Parallel Distributed Processing" course in University at Buffalo

A0:

This assignment was given to understand more the application of OMP which is used to implement parallel programming in shared memory. This code does a matrix multiplication such that with a nxn matrix A and a kxk matrix B (k<n) each kxk submatrix from matrix A will be multiplied with matrix B.

A1:

This assignment was given to understand the application of MPI which is used to implement programming in distributed memory. The code does a sort of all the numbers which are distributed initially over n number of processors.

A2:

This assignment was given to understand the application of Apache-Spark which is used to implement Map-Reduce over ditributed memory. Given a forest of nodes and its parents, the code fins the ID of the connected component it belongs to (i.e., the root of the connected component) and maps all the members of the node(including the root) to this ID.

A3:

This assignment was given to understand the application of CUDA which is used to implement parallel programming in GPU's (shared memory). Given a array of elements, we need to implement Guassian Kernel over all the elements.
